## Introduction
ISO 27018 is one of the ISO architecure security frameworks for protecting of personally identificable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processors. Organization can use these standard to design, implement and operate these PII systems. 

The framework is mostly using rules for public cloud service providers like Amazon Webservice(AWS) and Microsoft Azure to guide where personal information is stored and who can access it.

On every ocation when a store action is executed roles are being evaluated:
- Who is involved
- Who is responsible
- Who can modify the records

Based on above criteria a certified approval will be given on every request.

Rules of the ISO framework are a step ahead to gain more trust to cloud providers who are certified with ISO 27018. In case cloud providers are not certified it is still required to address information how data is stored and what kind of information. (article 14, law for the protectecion of personal information)

# History

* ISO27018 is based on the more common privacy standard: ISO27002 but improved for cloud perposes. 

# Approach

* Administration: Customers should have the oppertunity to administer there data

* Communication: In case of callamity like data leakage customer needs to be informed and appropriate support needs to be given
* Personal: Every employee with access to the data needs to sign a confidentiality statement
* Government: When government has granted access to the data, cloud supplier needs to address at the customer

# Practices
