## Introduction
ISO 27018 is one of the ISO architecture security frameworks for protection of personally identifiable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processors. Organization can use this standard to design, implement and operate PII systems. 

The framework is mostly using rules for public cloud service providers like Amazon webService(AWS) and Microsoft Azure to guide where personal information is stored and who can access it.

On every occasion when a stored action is executed roles are being evaluated:
- Who is involved
- Who is responsible
- Who can modify the records

Based on above criteria a certified approval will be given on every request.

Rules of the ISO framework are a step ahead to gain more trust to cloud providers who are certified with ISO 27018. In case cloud providers are not certified it is still required to address information how data is stored and what kind of information. (article 14, law for the protection of personal information)

## History

* It was created in 2014 as an addendum to ISO/IEC 27001, the first international code of practice for cloud privacy
* ISO27018 is based on the more common privacy standard: ISO27002 but improved for cloud purposes

## Approach

* Approval: Only personal information can be stored when client approved this. Information should be only stored when used for some kind of marketing information
* Administration: Customers should have the opportunity to administer there data
* Transparent: Cloud providers should approach there customers what data is stored. In case of third-party suppliers this needs to be addressed as well.
* Communication: In case of calamity like data leakage customer needs to be informed and appropriate support needs to be given
* Personal: Every employee with access to the data needs to sign a confidentiality statement
* Government: When government has granted access to the data, cloud supplier needs to address at the customer

## Practices

* Customers control their content
* Customers content will not be used for any authorized purposes
* Physical media is destroyed prior to leaving AWS data centers
* Physical media is destroyed prior to leaving AWS data centers
* Provides customers the means to delete their content
* Doesn't disclose customers content unless required to do so in order to comply with a legally valid and binding order, for example government or police

## Additional items to protect personal data

Apart from awareness and accountability there is also modern techniques in place to decrease the risk of gaining access to the PII systems. This is not part of the ISO 27018 framework

## Advantages and minors

<ins>Advantages</ins>
- ISO 27018 creates descent awareness of storing personal information
- Both customer and administrator of PII processor are triggered securing the data correctly and informing end-user this leads to reliability
- Implementing this framework gives a clear understanding who has access, who is involved and who responsible
- Faster enablement of global operations
- Legal protections for both cloud providers and users

<ins>Minors</ins>
- Tough information where data is stored and who can access it, still the framework doesn't give any guidance how the data is protected against theft or any form of personal data leakage
- No procedure is documented with this framework what happens when any kind of data leakage occurs
